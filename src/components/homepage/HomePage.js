                <p>Hi! My name is Tim! I am from a small town in Southern Illinois and I love everything home improvement. I have helped out a bunch of friends and family and over the years, have learned plumbing, electrical, installation, and much more. I figured I could bring my talents out to the public to help people with their projects, too. If you need my help, please click the button below to fill out a form. </p>
